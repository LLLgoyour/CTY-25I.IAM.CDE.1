Consider the statement $S$: ``If two integers are both even, then their product is even''.

(a) Write $S$ in the form ``for all\ldots, if\ldots, then\ldots'', using only mathematical symbols and variables.

$S$: $\forall a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, if $a$ and $b$ are both even, b then $ab$ is even.

(b) Write the negation of $S$ using only mathematical symbols and variables.

Negation of $S$: $\exists a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $a$ and $b$ are both even, but $ab$ is not even.

(c) Write the converse of $S$ using only mathematical symbols and variables.

Converse of $S$: $\forall a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, if $ab$ is even, then $a$ and $b$ are both even.

(d) Write the contrapositive of $S$ using only mathematical symbols and variables.

Contrapositive of $S$: $\forall a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, if $a$ is not even or $b$ is not even, then $ab$ is not even.

(e) Either prove or disprove $S$.

To prove $S$, we need to show that for any two even integers $a$ and $b$, their product $ab$ is even.

Proof: Let $a$ and $b$ be even integers. Then, we can write $a = 2k$ and $b = 2m$, where $k$ and $m$ are integers. Now, the product of $a$ and $b$ is $ab = (2k)(2m) = 4km$. Since $k$ and $m$ are integers, $4km$ is also an integer. Therefore, $ab$ is even.

This proof is now complete.
